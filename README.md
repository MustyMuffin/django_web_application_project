A web app called Learning Log that allows users to
log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and make journal entries as
they learn about each topic. 

The Learning Log home page
describes the site and invites users to either register or log in. 
Once logged in, a user can:
 - create new topics, 
 - add new entries, and 
 - read and edit existing entries.
